<h1>Why Netherlands? Why HZ? Why ICT? </h1>
<p>To be honest I am not sure why HZ, Netherlands. Probably because I have heard a lot of good things <br>
  from my friends who study in the Netherlands and from what I saw I really liked it.</p>
<p>The people, the cities, the country, so many opportunities, all of it sounded very attractive.</p>
<br />

<h3>The study programme suits my personality because ...</h3>
<p>Since I was young I had interests in everything new to me, especially technology and computers were not an exception. To be honest, at first I showed the most interest in video games and to this day from time to time I enjoy them. At the beggining, <br>
    I had no idea how people made computers, programms, I just enjoyed using them. But after some time I started wondering how I could make one myself, manage it and most importantly make peoples life easier. Since then it took my attention.</p>
<p>Study program provided by HZ looked very interesting and different from what I saw back in my country. You get a lot of practise with real people, companies, you can choose the path you want to go while studing. Most importantly you have a idea <br>
    of what you want to do after you finish your study.</p>

<h3>To sum up why HZ, ICT</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practical experience</li>
  <li>Great teachers</li>
  <li>Provides a choice</li>
  <li>A lot of opportunities</li>
  <li>Programm provides verything you need(study material)</li>
</ul>
